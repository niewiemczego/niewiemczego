# Hey, I'm Tim! 👾

Welcome to my space of breaking barriers and automating the impossible. When most intern/junior offers are declining, I try to stand out by doing what others don't - unlocking full API access for platforms like **Feeld**, **Hinge** and many more...

## What I Do
- **Reverse-Engineered APIs:** I dig deep into apps to understand and leverage their APIs.
- **Automation:** I build scalable systems for account creation, interaction automation and data management.
- **Data-Driven Solutions:** I design tools that streamline processes and reveal actionable insights.

## Featured Repositories
- **[Feeld](https://github.com/niewiemczego/Feeld):** Asynchronous API wrapper for the Feeld dating app, designed for multi-profile management and automation.
- **[BingX Sign Header Generator](https://github.com/niewiemczego/bingx-sign-header-generator):** Implementation for generating sign header, which is needed for identifying the request and ensuring its reality. It was reverse-engineered from their obfuscated JavaScript.
- **[Gmail Alias Generator](https://github.com/niewiemczego/gmail-alias-generator):** Web app to generate Gmail aliases using the "dot" and "plus" tricks to create variations for different services or tracking.

## Opportunities

I'm open to **challenging collaborations** and projects that push the limits of automation and reverse engineering. If you're looking to innovate or streamline processes, let's connect!
