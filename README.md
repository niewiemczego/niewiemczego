# Hey, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘¾

Welcome to my space of breaking barriers and automating the impossible. When most intern/junior offers are declining, I try to stand out by doing what others don't - unlocking full API access for platforms like **Feeld**, **Hinge** and many more...

## What I Do
- **Reverse-Engineered APIs:** I dig deep into apps to understand and leverage their APIs.
- **Automation:** I build scalable systems for account creation, interaction automation and data management.
- **Data-Driven Solutions:** I design tools that streamline processes and reveal actionable insights.

## Current Projects
- **Dating App API Automation:** Managing profiles, interactions, and analytics for dating platforms.
- **Sneaker Stock Monitoring:** Helping sneakerheads beat the bots with my Nike SNKRS Release Monitor.
- **Financial Tools:** Automating market data and trading with my Python-BingX library.

## Featured Repositories
- **[BingX Sign Header Generator](https://github.com/niewiemczego/bingx-sign-header-generator):** Implementation for generating sign header, which is needed for identifying the request and ensuring its reality.
- **[Nike SNKRS Release Monitor](https://github.com/niewiemczego/nike-stock-monitor):** A monitoring tool for nike sneakers releases.
