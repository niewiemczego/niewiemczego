# Tim (niewiemczego)

## Current Focus - API Intercepting / Bypassing Security Measures & Automation
I specialize in unlocking full API access for platforms that others can't touch 

## Stuff I'm Good At (not a genius, but I think decent tho)
- **Python** - I actually understand how Python works under the hood, not just how to use it.
- **Reverse Engineering** - Analyzing network traffic, deobfuscating JavaScript, and bypassing some anti-bot measures(only for educational purposes ofc).
- **Practical Scripting** - I build functional tools and bots to solve specific problems, keeping the code clean and effective.

## Opportunities
I am currently open to **challenging collaborations** that push the limits of automation. If you are looking to innovate processes others deem impossible, let's connect.
