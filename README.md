## Current Focus - Reverse Engineering & Automation
I specialize in unlocking full API access for platforms that others can't touch, including **Feeld**, **Hinge**, **Tinder**, and many more...

## Notable Projects
- [Feeld](https://github.com/niewiemczego/Feeld) - Asynchronous API wrapper for the Feeld, designed for multi-profile management and automation.
- [BingX Sign Header Generator](https://github.com/niewiemczego/bingx-sign-header-generator) - Implementation for generating sign headers reverse-engineered from obfuscated JavaScript. 
- [Gmail Alias Generator](https://github.com/niewiemczego/gmail-alias-generator) - Web app to generate Gmail aliases using "dot" and "plus" tricks for service variations.

## Stuff I'm Good At (not a genius, but I think decent tho)
- **Python** - I actually understand how Python works under the hood, not just how to use it.
- **Reverse Engineering** - Analyzing network traffic, deobfuscating JavaScript, and bypassing anti-bot measures(from time to time).
- **Practical Scripting** - I build functional tools and bots to solve specific problems, keeping the code clean and effective.

## Opportunities
I am currently open to **challenging collaborations** that push the limits of automation. If you are looking to innovate processes others deem impossible, let's connect.
